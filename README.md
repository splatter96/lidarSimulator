# lidarSimulator

This project will eventually contain a ROS node to simulate a LiDAR point cloud that would be generated by a placing objects in the scene discribed by stl objects.  
The data this simulation produces will eventually be used to train a neural network on detecting certain objects in  those point clouds.

The point cloud is generated by raytracing each laser beam produces by the LiDAR scanner.

The original raytracing code can be found under [tinytracer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer).

## TODO
- [x] Load different objects from stl files
- [x] Integrate in ROS compilation
- [ ] Use ROS/tf vectos and point objects
- [ ] Expose a ROS action or actionLib server
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] OpenCL for actual raytracing
